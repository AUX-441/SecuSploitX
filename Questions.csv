It helps students learn about web vulnerabilities, network security, and penetration testing methodologies in a controlled environment. However, it should only be used on authorized systems or dedicated lab environments."
"How do I interpret the results of a subdirectory scan?","Subdirectory scan results show discovered paths with their HTTP status codes. 200 status indicates successful discovery, while 404 means not found. Pay attention to directories containing administrative interfaces, configuration files, backup files, or sensitive information that shouldn't be publicly accessible."
"What is the difference between quick scan and full site scan?","Quick scan performs basic reconnaissance and common vulnerability checks, while full site scan conducts comprehensive analysis including deep crawling, all vulnerability tests, detailed information gathering, and thorough security assessment of the entire web application infrastructure."
"Can I schedule automated scans with Sploit?","While the current version doesn't have built-in scheduling, you can use external task schedulers (like cron jobs or Windows Task Scheduler) to run specific tools automatically. You would need to create scripts that invoke the individual scanning modules with appropriate parameters."
